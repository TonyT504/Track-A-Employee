# Track-A-Employee

As an employer, I would like to be able to track my employees and see their role, dept, and salary. This tracker would be perfect to implement with our human resources dept. 

When you invoke the application via command line, you'll see a menu with options (View all departments, View all Roles, View all employees, add dept, add an employee, and exit)
